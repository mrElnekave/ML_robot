# ML_robot

This project will house the final project finished by july 1, until then all project peices live in the following repos:

* Robot that can move using gradient descent and inverse kinematics. [here](https://github.com/mrElnekave/reacher-lab)
* Working with computer serial busses, this can send information to remote teensy controllers. [here](https://github.com/mrElnekave/lab1-2/)


### Learning
These projects required a great deal of learning as it was my first time playing around with Machine Learning, [here](https://github.com/mrElnekave/MachineLearningNg.git) is my interactive notebook for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning specialization
