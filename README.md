# ML_robot

This project will house the final project finished by july 1, until then all project peices live in the following repos:

* Robot that can move using gradient descent and inverse kinematics. [here](https://github.com/mrElnekave/reacher-lab)
    * ![Screenshot_20230604-092404](https://github.com/mrElnekave/ML_robot/assets/52299477/3111277e-f44c-478d-b178-94ed83afa408)
* Working with computer serial busses, this can send information to remote teensy controllers. [here](https://github.com/mrElnekave/lab1-2/)
    * ![PXL_20230419_204607219 TS_exported_19907_1685895967696](https://github.com/mrElnekave/ML_robot/assets/52299477/53516c73-720e-423b-bbdb-829cc4a50a56)


### Learning
These projects required a great deal of learning as it was my first time playing around with Machine Learning, [here](https://github.com/mrElnekave/MachineLearningNg.git) is my interactive notebook for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning specialization
